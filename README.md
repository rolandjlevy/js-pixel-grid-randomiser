### How it works ðŸ’¡

One pixel continuously changes colour and position in the 10x10 grid.

Each new position is chosen randomly: either one position up, down, left or right. This process repeats itself to create an organic animation.

The colour starts with hexadecimal value of #000000 (black) and with each move the colour increases by 1, making the next colour #000001 and so on.

The finishing hexadecimal colour is #ffffff (white) which means there are a total of 16,777,215 possible colours!

This explains how to [convert #ffffff to a decimal value](https://www.colorhexa.com/ffffff)
