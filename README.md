### Explanation ðŸ’¡

The pixel grid randomiser works like this:

One pixel moves continually, changing colour and position randomly with each move.

The starting position is chosen randomly from the 10x10 grid which makes 100 possible positions.

The next position is chosen randomly: either one position up, down, left or right. This process repeats itself to create an organic looking animation.

The colour starts with hexadecimal value of #000000 (black) and with each move the colour increments by 1, making the next colour #000001 and so on.

The finishing hexadecimal colour is #ffffff (white) which means there are a total of 16,777,215 possible colours! 

This explains how to convert #ffffff to a decimal value: https://www.colorhexa.com/ffffff
